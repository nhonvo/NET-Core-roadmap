practice managing classes, students, subjects, and scores using C# and ADO.NET.

You will create a simple console application that allows you to add and view classes, students, subjects, and scores. Here are the steps:

1.  Create a SQL Server database with the following tables:

    -   Class (ID, Name, Description)
    -   Student (ID, Name, Email, ClassID)
    -   Subject (ID, Name, Description)
    -   Score (ID, StudentID, SubjectID, ScoreValue)
2.  Create a C# console application that connects to the database using ADO.NET.

3.  Create classes for Class, Student, Subject, and Score that represent the corresponding database tables. Use properties to represent the columns in the tables.

4.  Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each class. Here are some examples:

    -   Add a new class to the database.

    -   Retrieve a list of all classes from the database.

    -   Update the name of a class in the database.

    -   Delete a class and all associated students and scores from the database.

    -   Add a new student to the database.

    -   Retrieve a list of all students in a class from the database.

    -   Update the email address of a student in the database.

    -   Delete a student and all associated scores from the database.

    -   Add a new subject to the database.

    -   Retrieve a list of all subjects from the database.

    -   Update the name of a subject in the database.

    -   Delete a subject and all associated scores from the database.

    -   Add a new score to the database.

    -   Retrieve a list of all scores for a student from the database.

    -   Update the score value for a score in the database.

    -   Delete a score from the database.

5.  Implement a menu system that allows the user to perform each operation. Here's an example menu:
    1. Class
        1.  Add a new class
        2.  View all classes
        3.  Update a class
        4.  Delete a class
        5.  Back to menu
    2. Student
        1.  Add a new student
        2.  View all students in a class
        3.  Update a student
        4.  Delete a student
        5.  Back to menu
    3. Subject
        1.  Add a new subject
        2. View all subjects
        3. Update a subject
        4. Delete a subject
        5.  Back to menu
    4. Score
        1. Add a new score
        2. View all scores for a student
        3. Update a score
        4. Delete a score
        5.  Back to menu
    5. Exit
6.  When the user selects an operation, prompt them for any necessary information (e.g., the name of a class or student) and perform the corresponding database operation using ADO.NET.

7.  Display the results of the operation to the user (e.g., a list of all students in a class).

8.  Handle any errors that may occur during database operations using try-catch blocks.

9.  Test your application thoroughly to ensure that all operations work correctly and handle errors properly.

This exercise will help you practice creating classes that represent database tables, performing CRUD operations using ADO.NET, and implementing a menu system in a console application. Good luck!
