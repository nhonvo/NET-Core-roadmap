exercises for practicing method overloading:

1.Create a class with two methods named "multiply" that accept integers as parameters. The first method should have 2 parameters and multiply the two integers together and return the result. The second method should have 3 parameters and multiply the three integers together and return the result.


2.Create a class with three methods named "divide" that accept doubles as parameters. The first method should have 2 parameters and divide the first double by the second double and return the result. The second method should have 3 parameters and divide the first double by the product of the second and third double and return the result. The third method should have 4 parameters and divide the product of the first and second double by the product of the third and fourth double and return the result.


3.Create a class with two methods named "concatenate" that accept strings as parameters. The first method should have 2 parameters and concatenate the two strings together and return the result. The second method should have 3 parameters and concatenate the three strings together in the order they are passed in and return the result.


4.Create a class with two methods named "average" that accept an array of integers as a parameter. The first method should calculate the average of all the integers in the array and return the result. The second method should calculate the average of the integers in the array that are greater than a specified value and return the result.


5.Create a class with two methods named "convert" that accept doubles as parameters. The first method should convert the double to an integer and return the result. The second method should convert the double to a string and return the result.


6.Create a class with two methods named "substring" that accept a string as a parameter. The first method should have 2 parameters and return a substring of the original string starting at the specified index and with the specified length. The second method should have 3 parameters and return a substring of the original string starting at the first specified index and ending at the second specified index.


7.Create a class with two methods named "compare" that accept two dates as parameters. The first method should compare the two dates and return true if the first date is earlier than the second date, false otherwise. The second method should compare the two dates and return the number of days between them.


8.Create a class with two methods named "swap" that accept arrays of integers as parameters. The first method should have 2 parameters and swap the values of the two elements at the specified indices. The second method should have 4 parameters and swap the values of the two elements at the first and second specified indices with the values of the two elements at the third and fourth specified indices.


9.Create a class with two methods named "replace" that accept a string as a parameter. The first method should have 2 parameters and replace all instances of a specified substring with a specified replacement string. The second method should have 3 parameters and replace the first specified character in the string with the specified replacement character.


10.Create a class with two methods named "max" that accept an array of integers as a parameter. The first method should find and return the maximum value in the array. The second method should find and return the index of the maximum value in the array.
