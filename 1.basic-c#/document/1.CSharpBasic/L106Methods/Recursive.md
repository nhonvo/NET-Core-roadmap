exercises to practice recursive methods:

1. Write a recursive method to calculate the factorial of a given number. Expectation: User inputs a number and the output is the factorial of that number.

2. Write a recursive method to calculate the sum of digits of a given number. Expectation: User inputs a number and the output is the sum of its digits.

3. Write a recursive method to calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. Expectation: User inputs the value of n and the output is the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.

4. Write a recursive method to calculate the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two given numbers. Expectation: User inputs two numbers and the output is their GCD.

5. Write a recursive method to reverse a given string. Expectation: User inputs a string and the output is the reversed version of the string.

6. Write a recursive method to check if a given string is a palindrome. Expectation: User inputs a string and the output is a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.

7. Write a recursive method to print the contents of a given array in reverse order. Expectation: User inputs an array of any type and the output is the contents of the array printed in reverse order.

8. Write a recursive method to count the number of occurrences of a given character in a given string. Expectation: User inputs a string and a character, and the output is the number of occurrences of the character in the string.

9. Write a recursive method to check if a given number is a prime number. Expectation: User inputs a number and the output is a boolean indicating whether the number is a prime number.
10. Write a recursive method to find the maximum element in a given array. Expectation: User inputs an array of integers and the output is the maximum element in the array.
