Expectation: The unit test should ensure that the method returns the correct length for a given string.

2. Write a unit test for a method that takes in two integers and returns the sum of the two integers.
Expectation: The unit test should ensure that the method returns the correct sum for two given integers.

3. Write a unit test for a method that takes in an array of integers and returns the sum of the integers.
Expectation: The unit test should ensure that the method returns the correct sum for a given array of integers.

4. Write a unit test for a method that takes in a string and a character, and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.
Expectation: The unit test should ensure that the method returns the correct number of occurrences for a given string and character.

5. Write a unit test for a method that takes in a list of integers and returns the largest integer in the list.
Expectation: The unit test should ensure that the method returns the correct largest integer for a given list of integers.
