1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100, and write an if statement that checks if the number is greater than 50. If it is, print "The number is greater than 50"; otherwise, print "The number is less than or equal to 50".


2. Write an if-else statement that checks if a number is even or odd. If it's even, print "The number is even"; otherwise, print "The number is odd".

3. Write an if-else statement that checks a student's grade and prints a message depending on the grade. If the grade is greater than or equal to 90, print "Excellent work!"; if it's between 80 and 89, print "Good job!"; if it's between 70 and 79, print "Nice try!"; and if it's less than 70, print "You need more practice!".

4. Write a switch statement that checks a person's job title and prints a message depending on the title. If the title is "Manager", print "You are in charge"; if it's "Employee", print "You work for the manager"; and if it's "Intern", print "You are learning".


5. Write a loop that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and prints the number until it generates the number 7.


6. Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 100, and keeps asking until the user enters a valid number.


7. Write a while loop that counts from 1 to 10 and prints each number.


8. Write a loop that generates 10 random numbers between 1 and 100, and prints the sum of the numbers.


9. Write a loop that prints the first 10 even numbers.


10. Write a loop that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and keeps generating numbers until it generates a number that is greater than 50.


11. Write an if statement that checks if a number is positive or negative, and prints a message accordingly.


12. Write a switch statement that checks the day of the week and prints a message depending on the day. If it's Monday, print "It's Monday, the week is starting"; if it's Friday, print "It's Friday, the weekend is almost here"; and if it's any other day, print "It's a regular day".


13. Write an if-else statement that checks if a number is divisible by 3 and/or 5, and prints a message accordingly. If it's divisible by 3, print "The number is divisible by 3"; if it's divisible by 5, print "The number is divisible by 5"; and if it's divisible by both, print "The number is divisible by both 3 and 5".


14. Write an expression that calculates the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 and a width of 10.


15. Write a loop that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.


16. Write an if-else statement that checks if a number is between 0 and 100, and prints a message accordingly. If it's between 0 and 50, print "The number is between 0 and 50"; if it's between 51 and 100, print "The number is between 51 and 100"; and if it's not between 0 and 100, print "The number is not between 0 and 100".


17. Write a loop that generates a random number between 1 and 100, and prints the number until it generates a number that is 55
