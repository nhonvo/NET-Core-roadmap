Instructions:

-   This test is designed to assess your proficiency in using LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) in C#.
-   The test consists of 10 questions, each with a different scenario requiring you to write LINQ queries.
-   For each question, write a method with the specified name and signature that performs the LINQ query and returns the result as described in the question.

1.  `int SumOfOddNumbers(List<int> numbers)`
    -   Given a list of integers, write a method to return the sum of all odd numbers in the list.
2.  `List<string> DistinctRepeatedWords(List<string> words)`
    -   Given a list of strings, write a method to return the distinct words that appear more than once in the list.
3.  `Dictionary<string, decimal> TotalPriceByCategory(List<Product> products)`
    -   Given a list of products with a "Category" & "Price" property, write a method to return a dictionary where the keys are the category names and the values are the total price of all products in that category.
4.  `(DateTime earliestDate, DateTime latestDate) GetEarliestAndLatestDates(List<DateTime> dates)`
    -   Given a list of dates, write a method to return the earliest and latest dates in the list.
5.  `List<int> TopFiveHighestNumbers(List<int> numbers)`
    -   Given a list of integers, write a method to return the top 5 highest numbers in the list.
6.  `string LongestWord(List<string> words)`
    -   Given a list of strings, write a method to return the longest word in the list.
7.  `List<string> CustomersInCitiesStartingWithA(List<Customer> customers)`
    -   Given a list of customers with a "City" property, write a method to return the names of customers who live in cities that start with the letter "A".
8.  `Dictionary<int, int> CountOfEachNumber(List<int> numbers)`
    -   Given a list of integers, write a method to return a dictionary where the keys are the numbers in the list and the values are the number of times each number appears in the list.
9.  `Dictionary<string, decimal> AveragePriceByCategory(List<Product> products)`
    -   Given a list of products with a "Price" property, write a method to return a dictionary where the keys are the category names and the values are the average price of products in that category.
10. `List<string> WordsContainingZ(List<string> words)`
    -   Given a list of strings, write a method to return the words in the list that contain the letter "z"
