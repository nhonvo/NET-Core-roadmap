practice OOP we try to archive 4 principles of oop in this practice.
1. Shape with the following methods:
- GetArea(): Returns the area of the shape
- GetPerimeter(): Returns the perimeter of the shape

2. Create two derived classes: Circle and Rectangle, that inherit from the Shape class.

3. The Circle class & Rectangle should implement how `GetArea()` & `GetPerimeter()`  work.

4. Create an array of Shape objects that includes both Circle and Rectangle objects.

Loop through the array and call the GetArea and GetPerimeter methods for each object in the array.

Print out the results for each shape.
